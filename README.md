To activate the model, you just need to run the baseline file.
I'm just rolling into computer vision and this is my first small project after studying a certain material. There is a baseline in the file - this is the basic solution, which actually contains the entire project code. The project uses OpenCV, and more specifically, in this solution, the most important thing is the algorithm for finding points on the ORB image. The prediction of the project is the name of the map, based on the photo of the map itself. I understand that the model is not perfect, but this is just the beginning. The solution did not train a neural network, but used ready-made algorithms
